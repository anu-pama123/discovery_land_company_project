            <p>Discovery Land Company is excited to announce our 25th residential club community on the majestic North Shore of Kaua’i. North Shore Preserve, a one-of-a-kind residential community, spans one thousand acres at the base of the mountains in the pastoral Hanalei valley. This newly re-imagined, low-density project is a secluded and peaceful island oasis with limited initial homesite and hale offerings.</p>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section2">    
            <p>North Shore Preserve will be a place where families will make lifelong memories for generations to come. Focusing on cultivating a healthy, balanced lifestyle, the private community will feature private beach access and a host of Outdoor Pursuits, Discovery’s authentic amenities and facilities, and signature member and residential service. </p><p>With a less-is-more development philosophy in mind, each gathering spot, program, and place is designed thoughtfully and minimally to showcase the island's beauty and potential for fun and adventure, including the Robert Trent Jones, Jr.-redesigned golf course and North Shore House. In the Discovery tradition, golf will be playable for all ages and skillsets and outfitted with comfort stations featuring drinks and local fare. </p>

        <div class="section3">    
            <p>The community will also include dining options emphasizing locally-sourced ingredients, fitness studios and trainers, spa and wellness facilities, a resort-style pool, and much more.</p><p>With 25 communities in its global portfolio to date, Discovery aims to build on its successes at previous projects such as Kuki’o Golf and Beach Club on the Big Island and Makena Golf and Ocean Club on Maui. Discovery’s distinguishing hallmark is a unique approach to each location, creating communities inspired by the surrounding natural and cultural environment. The Discovery philosophy emphasizes a family-focused lifestyle that is accentuated through its vertical membership structure, as well as by the distinct relaxed atmosphere that draws friends and neighbors together. Discovery will continue this beloved tradition at North Shore Preserve, creating an escape from the ordinary that effortlessly generates memories for members and their families.</p>
